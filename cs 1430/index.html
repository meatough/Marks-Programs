		<p>    
		     My Name is Mark, currently I work at Pilot Flying J as a maintenance team member, 
		but I am currently searching for computer science/software engineering related internships.  
		I have taken 21 credits of programming, and I know Java, C++, C# and Python.  This is my 
		first scripting class I have ever taken, so I am excited to be able to learn it as scripting 
		language skills seem to be in high demand in the job market.
